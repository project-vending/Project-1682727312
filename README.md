#  Cost Optimization using AWS Cost Explorer and Terraform: Use AWS Cost Explorer to optimize the cost of running data engineering solutions in AWS. Use Terraform to provision and automate the creation of different resources like EC2 instances, storage, and databases. Implement Streamlit to create a dashboard that shows insights about the cost of different AWS resources used in your projects. Use Fast API to build a RESTful API that exposes these insights to clients. Use Docker to containerize your code.
